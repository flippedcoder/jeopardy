This was actually a cool coding challenge I had once. This is 2 hours worth of work, but I plan on building it out into something interesting.

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

to get all of the required packages. Once the packages are done installing, you can run:

### `npm start`

and the app will load on localhost:3000
